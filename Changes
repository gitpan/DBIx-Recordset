Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Recordset

0.17  8 Oct 1998
  - DBIx::Recordset now can handle subtables. This means if you have
    one tables which has field which is an key for another table
    you are able to access the second table via $set{first}{subfield}
    DBIx::Recordset handles this by creating a special link field,
    which is actually a new Recordset object.
    Look at "Working with multiple tables" in the documentation.    
  - You can now call the method add to get an empty new record and
    then simply put data in the current record 
  - Metadata is cached, that means if you open the same table a
    second time DBIx::Recordset does not query the driver again
    for the metadata, but uses the cached values instead.
  - The Flush methods returns now undef on error, otherwise a true
    value
  - Adapted the data types for newer mSQL drivers in DBIx::Compat
  - Added documentation about working with mulitple tables
  - Added documentation about debugging and DBIx::Recordset logfile
  - DBD::CSV works together with DBIx::Recordset

0.16  26 Aug 1998
  - Reworked memory management
    1.) DBIx::Recordset will be correctly destroyed and the statement handles 
        released, if the object goes out of scope. (You don't need 
        DBIx::Recordset::Undef anymore to destroy an object)
    2.) Worked around a problem that perl will reference an object when a
        reference to it is return from the each operator. This causes reference count
        of the object not going to zero and therfore the object was not destroyed
        when it goes out of scope.

  - Ignore DBD::File for tests because it's just a base class
  - Added support for drivers which does not have field types 
    ($sth -> {TYPE})
  - Fixed return values from Select/Update/Insert/Search/Execute so
    they return undef on error. Spotted by Gary Ashton-Jones.
  - Documentation update

0.15  31 Jul 1998
  - Apdapt STORE method of tied array to perl5.005. DBIx::Recordset works
    now correctly with perl5.004 and perl5.005
  - Update can now handle updates of the primary keys correctly
  - Insert can be done by calling Setup and then write values to the
    array
  - Update works now without an primary key
  - Adapted Compat.pm to the new values in $sth -> {TYPE} of DBD::mSQL
    in 1.19_19 and higher. Spotted by Ray Zimmerman,
