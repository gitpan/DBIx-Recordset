DBIx::Recordset - Perl extension for DBI recordsets

EXAMPLES

The file search.htm (HTML::Embperl version) and search.pl (CGI.pm version)
contains a short example for a web page, where you can supply a table name
(and a search condition) to view the whole content or a part of a table.

NOTE: To view search.htm it's easier to use your browser then an ascii
editor.
